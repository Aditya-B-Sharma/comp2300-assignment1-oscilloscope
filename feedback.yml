    Well done on listing out the bugs you faced and including relevant diagrams.

  suggestions: >-
    Add comments to code.
    Fix incorrect spelling and grammar.
    There is a 2 page limit and you have gone up to 7.
    No need to mention specific registers, rather you should say what the value in the register represents.
    The picture on page 6 is completely unnecessary and shouldn't be included as it is basically a line by line explanation 
    of your whole code, to that point I have your 'actual' code to do this for me.
    You say additive synthesis would have been difficult but give no explanation for why this is.
    Your design document in parts tends to be quite airy, shorter more succinct explanations would help a lot.
